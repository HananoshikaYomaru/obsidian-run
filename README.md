### Syntax

Each block of run contains three parts: starting tag (required), generated content, ending tag

#### starting tag (required)

you define your expression in the starting tag. The expression will be used to calculate the content. It is the only required part for a run block.

```md
%% run start <expression> %%
```

or you can also write multiple line statements. Notice that if you write in multiple line you must return a value.

````md
%% run start

```ts|js
<your expression in codeblock>
```

%%
````

You can use it with [CodeblockCustomizer](https://github.com/mugiwara85/CodeblockCustomizer), to have folding codeblock.
